<h1>Hi, I'm Viviane!</h1>
<p>I'm a Recruiter turned Software Engineer. It has been a lifelong passion of mine to help others and find ways to solve problems (you can call me a problem-solving enthusiast!) I recently decided to make a career change where I dove into the world of coding.</p>

<p>My journey with software engineering started with a fascination as I was doing technical recruiting and was intrigued by the problems my peers were solving. I decided to take a few courses on data and Javascript and instantly fell in love. I finally took a leap of faith and signed up for an intensive 24-weeks coding bootcamp with App Academy.</p>

<p>The program provided me with structure and resources to continue my learning journey as a developer and hone in on my skills. I am now able to build meaningful applications where I am confident I can make a positive impact. I am lifelong learner and will always find different ways to dive into new technology so I can continue growing as a developer.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I am a full-time foodie who loves to travel! I’m not only a problem-solving enthusiast but I’m also a hot-pot enthusiast. You say “hot-pot” and I am there.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting and let's connect!</p>
